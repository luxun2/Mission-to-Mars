# Mission-to-Mars

This project focuses on using beautiful soup and splinter libraries to automate web browsing and web scraping. We scrap tables and specific headings and use the data presented to create informative graphs about mars using matplotlib library. Pandas dataframes and dictionaries would also be emphasized in this project.
